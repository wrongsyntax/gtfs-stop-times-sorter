# gtfs-stop-times-sorter
A small Python script to sort the stop_times.txt GTFS file into separate files based on stop ID.

### Usage
Download the Python script and run it using Python 3. You will need to specify the location of the stop_times.txt file, which can be downloaded from https://transitfeeds.com/ for the transit agency you need. You should also create an empty destination folder for the files, since there can be a large number that can be difficult to navigate.
